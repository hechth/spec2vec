## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.1] - 2024-08-06
### Changed
- Set max matchms to 0.26.4
- Set max scipy to 1.10.1

## [0.8.0] - 2022-01-06

### Changed

- Minor changes to make tests pass with new matchms versions (>=0.18.0). Should nearly always be backwards compatible though.
- Now dependency requirement is set to `matchms>=0.14.0`

## [0.7.0] - 2022-10-01

### Added

- added `spec2vec.serialization` subpackage to import and export `Word2Vec` models to/from disk without Pickle 
  (via `import_model` and `export_model` respectively) [#80](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/pull/80)

### Changed

- bumped **gensim** version to `>=4.2.0` in dependencies [#84](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/pull/84)

### Fixed

- updated Code examples in documentation to recent changes in matchms.

## [0.6.0] - 2022-01-03

### Added

- Logging (replacing former print statements) including options to write logs to file [#73](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/pull/73)
- Now supports Python 3.9 (including CI test runs) [#40](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/issues/40)

### Changed

- missing words percentage above the `allowed_missing_percentage` no longer causes an expection but only leads to raising a warning [#73](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/pull/73)
- default setting for `allowed_missing_percentage` to 10.0 to be less strict on model coverage [#72](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/pull/72)

### Fixed

- Can now also handle spectra in which no peak is known to the model (will return warning + empty vector) [#73](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/pull/73)

## [0.5.0] - 2021-06-18

### Changed

- Spec2Vec is now using gensim >= 4.0.0 [#62](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/pull/62)

## [0.4.0] - 2021-02-10

### Changed

- refactored `Spec2Vec` to now accept `Spectrum` or `SpectrumDocument` as input [#51](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/issues/51)

### Fixed

- updated and fixed code examples  [#51](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/issues/51)
- updated and fixed attribute typing [#51](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/issues/51)

## [0.3.4] - 2021-02-10

### Changed

- update required numba version to >=0.51 to avoid issues between numba and numpy [#55](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec/pull/55)
